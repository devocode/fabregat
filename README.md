# Gourmet Fabregat

Create cool off-screen slider menus for the Rails Asset Pipeline.

[Gourmet Fabregat][1] and [Jesper Josefsson][2] did all the hard work to get this put together.  I just updated a couple of things so that I wouldn't have to click the button a thousand times to get it to work with Turbolinks in Rails 4.  Use and enjoy.
